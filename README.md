# **Exploring Neuronal Subtypes in Alzheimer's Disease: A Single-Cell RNA-Seq and Machine Learning Study**

This project investigates the selective vulnerability (SV) of specific neuronal subtypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and machine learning approaches. By analyzing gene expression patterns in postmortem brain tissues, particularly focusing on excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC), this study aims to understand the susceptibility of distinct neuronal populations to degeneration and identify potential therapeutic targets to enhance neuronal resilience.

This analysis leverages the Seurat pipeline, a widely used tool for scRNA-seq data processing, adapted from the official PBMC3K tutorial but applied to a different dataset and with additional customizations.

## **Abstract**

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is characterized by tau pathology, neuronal loss with specific spatiotemporal patterns, and selective vulnerability (SV) of certain neuronal populations. This study utilizes scRNA-seq data derived from postmortem brain tissues to analyze gene expression and identify selectively vulnerable neuronal subtypes, focusing on excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC). By employing hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction methods, nine clusters (s1 to s9) were identified, with significant reduction in clusters s1, s2, and s4. Biomarkers like RORB were identified and validated as major markers for selective vulnerability. Through machine learning and clustering algorithms, we examined neuronal subtypes, their biomarkers, and their role in disease progression, providing insights for therapeutic strategies.

## **Motivation**

The motivation behind this study is to understand why certain neuronal populations are more susceptible to degeneration in AD. This understanding is critical in identifying therapeutic targets and enhancing neuronal resilience. AD is known for its selective vulnerability (SV), where specific neuronal types in brain regions like the entorhinal cortex (EC) are affected earlier and more severely. The study focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind this SV using advanced computational and molecular techniques.

## **Research Gap**

Despite extensive research on network-level vulnerability in AD, cellular-level mechanisms of SV remain poorly understood. Key gaps include:

* Limited understanding of the genetic and molecular factors driving SV.
* Lack of information on neuronal subpopulation variability in susceptibility.
* Insufficient knowledge of selective resilience (SR) and its relation to tau pathology or synaptic dysfunction.

Understanding these gaps can yield insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

## **Contribution**

This study contributes to AD research by:

* Identifying the optimal resolution for stable clustering, yielding biologically meaningful cell clusters.
* Discovering RORB as a major marker for selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the EC.
* Highlighting significant neuronal loss in clusters s1, s2, and s4, along with variations in biomarker expression across subpopulations.
* Performing refined subpopulation analyses to reveal differential loss patterns between neuronal populations.
* Unveiling biomarkers such as CD24, CSMD1, CADPS2, TLL1, and DOCK4 linked to selectively vulnerable neuronal subtypes.

## **Methodology**

### **Cell Nuclei Isolation and Data Generation**

Postmortem brain tissues were processed for snRNA-seq analysis, focusing on the entorhinal cortex (EC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). A total of 42,528 cells were analyzed, including 8,362 excitatory neurons. Using machine learning approaches, clustering algorithms identified distinct neuronal subtypes, and biomarker analysis highlighted selectively vulnerable populations.

* Scaling the data using ScaleData.
* Performing Linear dimensional reduction (PCA, ICA).
* Generating Elbow plots to determine the optimal dimensionality.

**Clustering:**

* Running FindNeighbors and FindClusters with varying resolution parameters.
* Visualizing the dependency of clusters on different resolutions.

**Marker Identification:**

* Identifying cluster markers using FindMarkers and FindAllMarkers.
* Filtering and visualizing top markers.
